# Build-Data-Dashboards
Udacity Data Visualization Project for the Junior Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Project Description

In this project, i'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

There are 3 different data sets you can choose from.

    Flight Delays and Cancellations
    US Census Demographic Data
    Youtube Data from the US

### 1) Flight Delays and Cancellations

- This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

- The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

You are required to create three visualizations.

### 2) US Census Demographic Data

- This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page. Required dashboards

You are required to create three visualizations.

### 3) Youtube Data US

- This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes a bunch of information for videos that were trending for at least one day. This data set will require some cleaning in excel prior to Tableau. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

You are required to create three visualizations.
